1. Make the variables as final which are immutable. 
Ex:If itemId should never change after construction (which is usually the case for IDs), mark it final: 
     private final String itemId;

2.To create a custom exception in Java, you define a new class that extends either:
   a.Exception (for checked exceptions), or
   b.RuntimeException (for unchecked exceptions).
