LLD Question: Design a Task Management System
---------------------------------------------

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
------------------
Design a Task Management System where:

1. A Manager can create a task and assign it to one or more Users.

2. A User can update the status of a task to "Not Started," "Pending," or "Completed."

3. A Manager can view all tasks they have assigned.

4. A User can view details of a task, including who assigned it.

5. The system should be thread-safe to handle concurrent task updates.

Follow-up Questions:
---------------------
Entities & Relationships
  -->Identify the main entities and their relationships.
Database Schema
  -->How would you design tables to store managers, users, tasks, and their statuses?
API Endpoints
  -->Define RESTful APIs for creating, updating, and retrieving tasks.
Concurrency & Thread Safety
  -->How will you ensure thread safety when multiple users update a task simultaneously?
Scaling & Optimization
  -->How would you scale this system to handle thousands of concurrent users?
