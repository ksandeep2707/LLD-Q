PROBLEM STATEMENT:
------------------
You are developing a stock price alert system for an investment platform.
Users should be able to subscribe to stock price updates and receive notifications when the price changes.
The system should allow multiple users to track the same stock, and they should be notified whenever its price is updated.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
The system should allow users to subscribe and unsubscribe from stock price alerts dynamically.
Whenever the stock price changes, all subscribed users should be notified automatically.
Adding new types of subscribers (e.g., SMS alerts, Email alerts) should be possible without modifying existing code (follows the Open/Closed Principle).


Test Cases:
-----------
1. Test Single Observer Subscription

Given a Stock subject with "AAPL" stock
And an EmailObserver subscribed to it
When the stock price is updated to 150.0
Then the EmailObserver should receive a notification:
ðŸ“© "Email Alert: Stock AAPL updated to 150.0"

2. Test Multiple Observers for the Same Stock

Given a Stock subject with "TSLA" stock
And an EmailObserver and SMSObserver subscribed to it
When the stock price is updated to 720.5
Then both observers should receive notifications:
ðŸ“© "Email Alert: Stock TSLA updated to 720.5"
ðŸ“² "SMS Alert: Stock TSLA updated to 720.5"

3. Test Unsubscribing an Observer

Given a Stock subject with "GOOGL" stock
And an EmailObserver and SMSObserver subscribed to it
When the SMSObserver unsubscribes
And the stock price updates to 2800.0
Then only the EmailObserver should receive a notification:
ðŸ“© "Email Alert: Stock GOOGL updated to 2800.0"
ðŸ”´ SMSObserver should NOT receive any notification.

4. Test Adding a New Observer Type Without Modifying Existing Code

Given a Stock subject with "MSFT" stock
And a new observer type (e.g., PushNotificationObserver) is introduced without modifying existing Stock/Observer classes
When a user subscribes via push notification
And the stock price updates to 305.0
Then the new observer should receive a notification:
ðŸ“² "Push Notification: MSFT stock updated to 305.0"
