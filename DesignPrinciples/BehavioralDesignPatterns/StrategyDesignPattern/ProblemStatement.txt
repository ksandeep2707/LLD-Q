PROBLEM STATEMENT:
-------------------
You are building a payment system for an e-commerce website. 
The system should support multiple payment methods like Credit Card, PayPal, and UPI. 
The payment method should be selected at runtime, and the system should be flexible enough to add new payment methods in the future without modifying existing code.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
The system should allow users to choose a payment method dynamically.
Adding a new payment method should not require modifying existing payment logic.
The solution should follow the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) by enabling extension without modification.




Test Cases:
1.Test Credit Card Payment

Given a CreditCardPayment strategy
When a user pays 100.0
Then the system should confirm "Paid 100.0 using Credit Card."

2.Test PayPal Payment

Given a PayPalPayment strategy
When a user pays 200.0
Then the system should confirm "Paid 200.0 using PayPal."

3.Test UPI Payment

Given a UPIPayment strategy
When a user pays 150.0
Then the system should confirm "Paid 150.0 using UPI."

4.Test Dynamic Strategy Switching

Given a PaymentContext with CreditCardPayment
When a user pays 300.0
Then the system should confirm "Paid 300.0 using Credit Card."
When the strategy is changed to PayPalPayment and the user pays 500.0
Then the system should confirm "Paid 500.0 using PayPal."
When the strategy is changed to UPIPayment and the user pays 250.0
Then the system should confirm "Paid 250.0 using UPI."
